CSC 132 Final Project Ideas:

1) A Game
    - Text based game, where the user uses a GUI instead of typing 
    - Any other game ideas can go here
	~ example 1: Game of Life (board game) with a digital representation of players' money, family, etc. and/or the current state of the board (small board)
			> would include addition such as option for player's to avoid making required payments or to make choices on tiles that 
			> could come back and land them in an added jail
	~ example 2: Mancala with recommended move button in GUI 
			> could add a new feature to the game and a indication of best times to use it
			> could show the board (programming Mancala is something that is easy to find, so additions are kind of necessary)
	~ example 3: A trivia game that gathers time for completion (and/or gets a score) and sends an email to someone the user inputs to try the quiz too
			> might need more questions than what one run-through might actually ask a player 
			>  (25 total question, 4-8 questions per quiz, randomly use questions)
			> could use audio files of someone reading the questions

2) A program that uses a USB stick plugged into a machine to read and write to files
	- maybe allow user to upload a picture of themself

3) A security program operating via password generation or encrypting certain files (using the more secure 'secrets' python class, maybe)
	- might be something to add to another idea like encrypting files that come from #2

4) A program that either takes in recorded audio or just plays recorded audio when user prompts it
	- (someone else is doing "Do You Want to be a Millionaire", but this made me think of the help call)
	-  could play back audio based on user's input (likely text based or a button press)
	- could just mix the sounds up
	
5) version of War (card game) utilizing stacks
	- could use a betting system for "battles" and entire "War"
	- could make modifications to the deck to where probablilities are uneven (6 kings, 2 "7's")
	- could provide the ability for user to view which cards have been 'deployed' (are no longer in the deck)

Preferred ideas (pending): 
*  implementation of the game Mancala with a recommended button for the user, and multiple CPU opponent difficulties 
	(possible added feaure to the game which the recommended button would tell user best time to use; possible representation of board in GUI)

*  Trivia game that gets user's time spent on questions/entire quiz and gets a score (might use audio to read the questions or other utilization);
	should also send an email to a user inputted gmail to share their score

*  implementation of War card game 
	- unsure about modifications, but a few possible things:
		> choice for user to play or bet (and likely choose a side)
		> playing/betting can last for individual 'battles' or the entire 'War' (one round or whole game)
		> provide ability for user to view which cards in the deck have been played after the round has passed
		> possible modifications to the deck (based on user's choice) to make chances of winning higher/lower
